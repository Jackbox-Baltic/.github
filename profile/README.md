<strong>Jackbox Baltic United</strong> an independent initiative, brings together the love for Jackbox Games party games and a wish to provide people of Estonian, Latvian, and Lithuanian backgrounds a chance to have the same fun in their native language! We're a small team with diverse backgrounds, working on translating, coding, and localizing many Jackbox Games releases. We are just starting our way into localization of games, so you can help us by joining our team on the [discord server](https://discord.com/invite/TNK3wsHHUW)!
